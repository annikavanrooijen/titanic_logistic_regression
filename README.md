**Description of the Titanic Kaggle Competition:**

The Titanic Kaggle competition is a data science challenge that is inspired by one of the most infamous maritime disasters in historyâ€”the sinking of the RMS Titanic. Kaggle, a popular platform for data science competitions, hosts this challenge to engage data scientists, machine learning enthusiasts, and researchers worldwide. The goal of the competition is to predict which passengers survived the tragic event based on a provided dataset of passenger information.

**Background:**
On April 15, 1912, the RMS Titanic, a luxurious British passenger liner, collided with an iceberg and sank during its maiden voyage from Southampton, UK, to New York City, USA. The disaster resulted in the loss of over 1,500 lives, making it one of the deadliest maritime accidents in history. The tragedy sparked significant changes in maritime safety regulations and continues to capture the public's fascination and interest to this day.

**The Challenge:**
Participants in the Titanic Kaggle competition are given two datasets: a training set and a test set. Each dataset contains various attributes of passengers aboard the Titanic, such as their age, sex, ticket class, cabin location, family relationships, and fare paid. The training set also includes a binary target variable, indicating whether the passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0) the disaster.

The objective of the competition is to use the provided training set to build a predictive machine learning model that can accurately determine the survival outcomes of passengers in the test set. The test set contains similar passenger information but does not include the survival information. Participants must apply their model to predict the survival probabilities for these passengers.

**Evaluation:**
Submissions are evaluated based on their predictive accuracy. The primary evaluation metric used for this competition is usually the percentage of correctly predicted passenger survival outcomes, often referred to as "accuracy." The higher the accuracy achieved by a participant's model on the test set, the better their solution performs.

**EDA Summary of the Findings in the Test Data:**
- 62.36% of the total number of passengers died (444 People)
- biggest age group of passenger: between 18 and 35
- there were more male passenger on the ship
- Factors for survivial: 
    - age: children 
    - gender: woman had a higher chance of survivial in the first and second class
    - passenger class: in the third class the survivial rate for women was about 50:50, most men died in the third class
